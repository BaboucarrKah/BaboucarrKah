# 👨‍💻 Cybersecurity | 🛡️ Pentesting & Defense | ☁️ Cloud | ⚡ Automation | 🎮 Gaming & 🎨 3D/Blender

# Hi — I'm Baboucarr 👋

Recently graduated in **Cybersecurity** with a strong interest in **penetration testing, cyber defense, automation, and cloud security**.  
I work on practical projects that develop skills in **ethical hacking, security analysis, and defensive strategies**.  

Outside of cybersecurity, I’m passionate about **gaming** and use **Blender** as a creative outlet.  
I enjoy designing **3D models, animations, and visual effects**, which allows me to explore creativity, problem-solving, and technical skills from a different perspective.  
Working with Blender has also given me experience in workflows like **rendering, texturing, and animation** — skills that complement my analytical mindset from cybersecurity.
